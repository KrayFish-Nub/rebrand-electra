# Electra V13
- If you are coming from (Old Source)[https://github.com/Konrad570/Electra-Bot], you are right here!
- Updated Version (discord.js **V13**) + **Slash Commands** + **MongoDB**

# Setup
- Copy paste **example.env** and paste it into a **.env** file!
- This should not be in any folder, it should be in the main directory.
- If you are on MAC/Linux, delete the .bat files (anticrash, launcher).

# Slash Commands
- Slash Commands are not working very well, this is why bugs may be within this Code.
- To deploy Slash Commands directly (one-guild), go into src/deployCommands and change Guild/Bot ID.
- To deploy Slash Commands for build-version, path into the src folder and run **node deployCommands.js**.

# Support
- Please leave a like (star) on the Repo if we could help you grow your Bot and make it unique!
- Feel free to open Issue/Pull Requests if you find any Bug/Issue within the new Beta Code.
- If you don't want to copy paste and use the Bot instead, invite it [here](https://top.gg/bot/841978658373894174)
